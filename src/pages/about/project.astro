        </ScrollReveal>

        <ScrollReveal client:load delay={0.4}>
          <h2>Framework</h2>
          <p>
            A research-driven framework that leverages <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> as advanced, <strong>model-agnostic explainers and fairness evaluators</strong>, integrating insights from established explainability and fairness approaches into <strong>clear, human-understandable outputs</strong>.
          </p>
        </ScrollReveal>

        <ScrollReveal client:load delay={0.5}>
          <h2>Toolset</h2>
          <p>
            An <strong>open-source toolset and visualization platform</strong> that embeds the framework into real AI pipelines and presents explanations and fairness reports in a <strong>transparent, user-friendly way</strong>, enabling human insight, interaction, and feedback.
          </p>
        </ScrollReveal>

        <ScrollReveal client:load delay={0.6}>
          <h2>Evaluation & Case Studies</h2>
          <p>
            A two-track validation approach combining <strong>in-lab experimentation</strong> for method development and fine-tuning with <strong>in-the-wild case studies</strong> involving stakeholders, assessing usability, trust, clarity, and overall impact through iterative evaluation.
          </p>

        <ScrollReveal client:load delay={0.7}>
          <h2 class="mt-12">The Key Pillars of EXCALIBUR</h2>
        </ScrollReveal>

        <ScrollReveal client:load delay={0.8}>
          <h3>Regulatory-to-Technical Mapping</h3>
          <p>
            The systematic translation of <strong>Trustworthy AI principles and regulatory requirements</strong> into concrete technical specifications and ethical guidelines that shape the framework and platform design.
          </p>
        </ScrollReveal>

        <ScrollReveal client:load delay={0.9}>
          <h3>Model-Agnostic Explainability and Fairness, Powered by LLMs</h3>
          <p>
            LLM-based components that produce <strong>human-like explanations and contextual fairness interpretations</strong> across tasks and metrics, supporting the identification and understanding of potential sources of bias in data and models.
          </p>

        <ScrollReveal client:load delay={1.0}>
          <h3>Open Tools and Stakeholder-Driven Validation</h3>
          <p>
            An <strong>open infrastructure</strong> for reuse (covering code, tools, and platform components) combined with <strong>continuous evaluation involving researchers and non-expert users</strong>, ensuring practical usefulness and societal relevance.
