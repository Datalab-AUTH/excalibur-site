We're excited to launch the **EXCALIBUR project** and welcome you to our community of researchers, developers, and stakeholders committed to advancing trustworthy and responsible artificial intelligence.

## What is EXCALIBUR?

EXCALIBUR is an EU-funded research initiative that bridges regulatory principles with technical innovation. Our mission is to democratize access to tools and methodologies for building explainable, fair, and accountable AI systems-making trustworthy AI accessible to everyone.

## Our Approach

Our project is built on three interconnected pillars:

**1. Regulatory-to-Technical Mapping**  
We translate international AI ethics frameworks and regulatory requirements into concrete technical specifications. Learn more about our [objectives and methodology](/about).

**2. LLM-powered Explainability & Fairness**  
We develop advanced, model-agnostic tools that generate human-readable explanations and fairness assessments. Explore our [core framework and components](/about).

**3. Open Tools & Stakeholder Validation**  
We're building an open-source platform with intuitive visualizations and an iterative design process involving real users. Check out our [software and tools](/research/tools) in development.

## Our Journey

The project combines rigorous in-lab experimentation with real-world case studies in the wearables domain, where trust, clarity, and fairness are especially critical. We follow a [citizen-science approach](/research/citizen-science) to ensure our tools meet authentic user needs.
## Get Involved
